**How to build and run?**  
First, make sure Rust is installed. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **For Arch Linux:**  
   Run the following commands:  
   ```
   sudo pacman -S rustup
   rustup default stable
   ```

2. **For Debian-based distros (e.g., Ubuntu):**  
   Run the following commands:  
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install rustup
   rustup default stable
   ```

**Building the project:**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Xethium-Software/Apptrium/
   cd Apptrium
   ```

2. Build the project using Cargo:  
   ```
   cargo build
   ```
   This will compile all the libraries and dependencies.

3. Run the project:  
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

Alternatively, download the latest release from the Releases tab and run the pre-built binary. If no release is available, it means the project is still under development.
